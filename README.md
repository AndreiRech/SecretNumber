# ‚ÑπÔ∏è INTRODUCTION

This is a simple game with voice recognition made to run on browsers. Use your voice to get the secret number right!

# üõë BEFORE YOU PLAY

**1.** I just tested it on *Edge*, but with *Chrome* it **should** also work (but if it will I really don't know)

**2.** Sometimes the API that I used to get your voice recognized may be slow, so **be pacient**!

**3.** You need to say the numbers in **English**!
